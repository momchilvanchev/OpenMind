14.10.2024 ( Momchil Vanchev ):
Hello, at the time of writing, I'm 15. I am focused on my expanding business Adonis AI. I am the only person that's part of the OpenMind team at the moment and I want to dedicate my life to this as I believe it is a very important mission. As I am focused on other things in life right now, I will be working on this project in my free time. Again, I must state, how ambitious of a project this is, but as brain chip interfaces are the future, someone needs to create the Linux of BCIs. With the passing of time, I hope to find other competent programmers and neurologists that will contribute to this mission, as I cannot do all of this alone. I hope to be able to pour more time and money into the development and build a massive community around this project.
