# OpenMind

OpenMind aims to revolutionize brain-computer interfaces with a **fully autonomous** and **open-source** solution. We prioritize **user freedom**, **privacy**, and **security**, empowering individuals to utilize their minds without fear of manipulation.

## The Importance of Autonomy

Surrendering control over your mind leads to severe consequences:

- **Loss of Personal Freedom:** You will become a passive participant in systems that dictate your thoughts.
- **Data Exploitation:** Your thoughts and decisions will be exploited for external agendas.
- **Mental Manipulation:** You will not only be read like a book by those with malicious intentions, but your thoughts and emotions will be influenced and you will become a puppet.

## This is why:

OpenMind is dedicated to safeguarding your most personal space — your mind — by providing a **secure**, **transparent**, and **user-first** platform. Join us in taking back control and ensuring your thoughts remain your own.

# Important!:

This project is extremely ambitious and will take decades to complete. It is moved forward by volunteers who want to benefit humanity in a meaningful way!
